Feature: Election Result Calculation
As a client of the API at the end of a majority vote
I want to calculate the result of the vote
So that I can obtain the winner of the vote

Scenario: Single candidate has more than 50% of votes
	Given the election has closed
	And there are 3 candidates
	And candidate 1 has 51% of the votes
	When I calculate the result of the election
	Then candidate 1 should be declared the winner


#test


#Scenario: No single candidate has more than 50% of votes
#	Given the election has closed
#	And there are 3 candidates
#	And candidate 1 has 49% of the votes
#	And candidate 2 has 30% of the votes
#	And candidate 3 has 21% of the votes
#	When I calculate the result of the election
#	Then a second round of election should be held
#	And only candidate 1 and 2 should participate in the second round

#	Scenario: Second round election results in tie
#		Given the second round of election has closed
#		And there are 2 candidates
#		And both candidates have 50% of the votes each
#		When I calculate the result of the second round of election
#		Then no winner can be determined

#	Scenario: Second round election results in a winner
#		Given the second round of election has closed
#		And there are 2 candidates
#		And candidate 1 has 60% of the votes
#		And candidate 2 has 40% of the votes
#		When I calculate the result of the second round of election
#		Then candidate 1 should be declared the winner */
